Enter the answer to this forensic question below 

------------------------------------------------ 

There is a web application running in a docker container on your system. You 
put it there so you could practice testing web applications for security 
vulnerabilities.

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:6443 to find it.

It is especially vulnerable to simple SQL injection attacks.

To answer this question, you need to log in as the application's 
administrative user and click a link to the flag.

1. Find out the name of the administrative user
2. Bypass authentication for this user on the login page using SQL injection
3. Click the link to the flag
4. Enter the text of the flag

There are other ways to capture this flag. Using SQL injection in the login 
form is by far the easiest of them.
